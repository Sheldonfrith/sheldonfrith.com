            <h4>Self-motivated and hard-working</h4>
            <p>
            In all of my past jobs I have proven that I don’t need any external motivation to work hard. I live
            by the motto “If something is worth doing, it is worth doing well.”
            </p>
            <h4>Open minded, comfortable in unfamiliar situations</h4>
            <p>
            I grew up in Brazil, and have lived in many places including BC, SK, NWT, and Ontario. I’ve
            traveled in Asia and through all the Americas (North, Central and South). Living in many
            different locations as well as working in many different diverse fields has given me the ability to
            excel in unfamiliar environments and adapt to new situations.
            </p>
            <h4>Good communicator, mediator, and manager</h4>
            <p>
              I have lots of experience managing and training other workers at
              several different jobs (Front Desk Ltd, Northern Farm Training
              Institute, Buffalo Air Express, Fazenda Meats). I’ve taught adult
              learning courses, have experience with sales, and I’m always
              professional.
